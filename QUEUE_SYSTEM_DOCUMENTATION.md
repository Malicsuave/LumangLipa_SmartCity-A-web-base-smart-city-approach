# Queue System Implementation for Talk to Agent Feature

## Overview
Implemented a complete queue management system for the "Talk to Agent" feature in the floating chatbot, allowing users to see their queue position and admins to manage conversations one at a time.

## Features Implemented

### User Side (Public Floating Chatbot)
1. **Queue Entry**
   - When a user clicks "Talk to Agent", they join a queue
   - Shows queue position: "You are #X in line"
   - Real-time queue position updates every 3 seconds
   - Visual indicator showing current position

2. **Queue Status Display**
   - **Waiting**: Shows yellow badge with queue position
   - **Active**: Shows green badge when connected to agent
   - **Completed**: Shows blue "Conversation Ended" notification
   - Automatic notification when agent becomes available
   - Automatic notification when admin ends conversation

3. **Message Blocking**
   - Users cannot send messages while in queue (status: waiting)
   - Shows warning: "Please wait for your turn. You are #X in line"
   - Messages enabled only when conversation becomes active
   - Messages blocked after conversation is completed
   - Shows message: "This conversation has ended"

### Admin Side (Admin Floating Chatbot)
1. **Queue Dashboard**
   - Shows count of waiting users: "X Users Waiting"
   - "Accept Next User" button when no active conversation

2. **Active Conversation Management**
   - Only ONE active conversation per admin at a time
   - Shows current user info and conversation history
   - "Complete & Next" button in chat header
   - Automatic transition to next user in queue

3. **Workflow**
   - Admin clicks "Accept Next User" ‚Üí Conversation activates
   - Chat with user until issue is resolved
   - Click "Complete & Next" ‚Üí Current conversation completes, next user loads automatically
   - If no users in queue ‚Üí Returns to inbox view

## Queue Logic Flow

### User Perspective
1. User clicks "Talk to Agent" button
2. System checks for existing queue entry
3. If new: Assigns queue position, creates entry
4. Shows queue position: "#X in line"
5. Polls every 3s for status updates
6. When admin accepts: Status changes to 'active'
7. Shows "Agent Connected!" notification
8. Enables messaging
9. User chats with agent
10. When admin completes: Status changes to 'completed'
11. Shows "Conversation Ended" notification
12. Header resets to "Barangay Chatbot"
13. Polling stops automatically
14. Message input is disabled

### Admin Perspective
1. Opens admin chatbot
2. Sees "X Users Waiting" if queue has users
3. Clicks "Accept Next User"
4. First user in queue becomes active
5. Conversation loads automatically
6. Chats with user
7. Clicks "Complete & Next"
8. Current conversation marked completed
9. Next user automatically loaded
10. If no more users: Returns to inbox

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed. The system uses existing database and authentication setup.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Polling Interval**: 3 seconds (adjustable in code)
2. **Queue Position Calculation**: Indexed query, O(1) complexity
3. **Message Filtering**: Uses database indexes for fast filtering
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Timestamp-based checking

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Priority Queue**: VIP or urgent users jump queue
2. **Estimated Wait Time**: Calculate based on average conversation time
3. **Admin Status**: Show admin as "busy" or "available"
4. **Queue Abandonment**: Auto-remove users who wait too long
5. **Chat Transfer**: Transfer conversation to another admin
6. **Conversation Rating**: Users rate support after completion
7. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track queue metrics and admin performance
8. **Push Notifications**: Notify users when their turn is near
9. **Multiple Queues**: Separate queues by department/topic
10. **Canned Responses**: Quick reply templates for admins

## Notes

- System handles only ONE active conversation per admin at a time
- Queue is FIFO (First In, First Out)
- All operations are handled in the floating chatbot
- No page refresh required for queue updates
- Automatic fallback if network issues occur
