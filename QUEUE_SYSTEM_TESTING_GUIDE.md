---

## Test 5: Edge Cases

### User Closes Browser While Waiting
1. User joins queue (#3 in line)
2. Close user's browser
3. **Expected**: Queue position remains (conversation is not cleaned up automatically)
4. Note: User won't receive messages, but position stays until admin accepts

### Admin Closes Browser During Conversation
1. Admin accepts user
2. Close admin browser
3. Reopen and login
4. **Expected**: Conversation may still show as "active"

3. **Expected**: No "Accept Next User" button

---

## Test 6: Message Flow

### User â†’ Admin

### Admin â†’ User
1. Admin sends: "Hi! How can I help you?"
2. **Expected**: Appears immediately in admin's chat
3. **Expected**: Appears in user's chat within 3 seconds (polling interval)

---

## Test 7: Conversation End Notification

### User Receives End Notification
1. User is in active conversation with admin
2. Both are exchanging messages
3. In admin window, click "Complete & Next" button
4. Confirm the action

### User Window (Should Show):
1. **Expected**: Blue notification box appears
2. **Expected**: Shows "âœ“ Conversation Ended"
3. **Expected**: Message says "The agent has ended this conversation"
4. **Expected**: Shows "Thank you for contacting us!"
5. **Expected**: Suggests starting new conversation
6. **Expected**: Header changes back to "ðŸ’¬ Barangay Chatbot"
7. **Expected**: Message input still visible but messages won't send

### Try Sending Message After End
1. User tries to type and send a message
2. **Expected**: Shows warning: "This conversation has ended. Please start a new conversation if you need more help."
3. **Expected**: Message is not sent

### Verify Polling Stopped
1. Open browser Network tab
2. After conversation ends, wait 10 seconds
3. **Expected**: No more requests to `/queue-status` or `/new-messages`
4. **Expected**: Polling has stopped

---

## Test 8: Multiple Status Transitions

### Complete Flow Test
1. **User joins queue** â†’ See "You are #1 in line" (Waiting)
2. **Admin accepts** â†’ See "âœ… Agent Connected!" (Active)
3. **Exchange messages** â†’ Messages flow both ways
4. **Admin completes** â†’ See "âœ“ Conversation Ended" (Completed)
5. **User refreshes page** â†’ Chatbot resets, can start fresh conversation

### Expected Status Changes:
- `waiting` â†’ Yellow badge, blocked messages
- `active` â†’ Green badge, enabled messages
- `completed` â†’ Blue notification, blocked messages, polling stopped

---

## Troubleshooting

### Queue Position Not Updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/api/agent-conversation/{sessionId}/queue-status` is responding
- Check polling is working (should see requests every 3 seconds in Network tab)

### Messages Not Appearing
- Check `/api/agent-conversation/{sessionId}/new-messages` endpoint
- Verify CSRF token is present
- Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Accept Next User Not Working
- Verify admin is logged in
- Check admin doesn't already have active conversation
- Check queue has users: `/api/admin/agent-conversation/active`

### Complete & Next Not Working
- Check conversation is active
- Verify session_id is correct
- Check for JavaScript console errors

---

## Expected Database States

### User Waiting in Queue
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_conversations WHERE queue_status = 'waiting';
```
Should show records with:
- `queue_status` = 'waiting'
- `queue_position` = their position number
- `queued_at` = timestamp when joined
- `assigned_admin_id` = NULL

### Active Conversation
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_conversations WHERE queue_status = 'active';
```
Should show records with:
- `queue_status` = 'active'
- `assigned_admin_id` = admin's user ID
- `assigned_at` = timestamp when activated

### Completed Conversation
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_conversations WHERE queue_status = 'completed';
```
Should show records with:
- `queue_status` = 'completed'
- `conversation_completed_at` = timestamp when completed
- `is_active` = 0 (false)

---

## Performance Checks

### Polling Frequency
- Open browser Network tab
- Count requests to `/queue-status` and `/new-messages`
- **Expected**: 1 request every 3 seconds

### Database Queries
Monitor database queries:
```bash
php artisan telescope
```
- Check queries are using indexes
- Verify no N+1 query issues
- Queue position calculation should be fast (<50ms)

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… Users can join queue and see their position  
âœ… Queue position updates in real-time  
âœ… Users cannot send messages while waiting  
âœ… Admin can only handle 1 conversation at a time  
âœ… Admin can see queue count  
âœ… Admin can accept next user  
âœ… Admin can complete and move to next  
âœ… Messages flow bidirectionally  
âœ… System handles empty queue gracefully  
âœ… UI updates reflect queue status changes  
âœ… User receives notification when conversation ends  
âœ… Polling stops after conversation completion  
âœ… User cannot send messages after conversation ends  

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Queue position shows but doesn't decrease
**Solution**: Check if admins are actually accepting and completing conversations

### Issue: "Accept Next User" does nothing
**Solution**: Verify admin doesn't already have an active conversation

### Issue: Messages delayed or not appearing
**Solution**: Check polling interval, verify endpoints are responding

### Issue: User stuck in queue
**Solution**: Admin needs to accept them, or manually update database:
```sql
UPDATE agent_conversations 
SET queue_status = 'cancelled' 
WHERE session_id = 'xxx';
```

### Issue: Multiple admins see same queue count
**Solution**: This is expected - any admin can accept the next user

---

## Browser Console Commands (For Debugging)

### Check User Chatbot State
```javascript
console.log('Queue Position:', window.barangayChatbot.queuePosition);
console.log('Queue Status:', window.barangayChatbot.queueStatus);
console.log('Agent Session:', window.barangayChatbot.agentSessionId);
```

### Check Admin Chatbot State
```javascript
console.log('Current Conversation:', window.adminChatbot.currentConversationId);
console.log('View:', window.adminChatbot.currentView);
```

### Force Queue Status Check
```javascript
// User side
window.barangayChatbot.checkQueueStatus();

// Admin side
window.adminChatbot.loadActiveConversations();
```

---

## Clean Up After Testing

### Reset Queue
```sql
-- Clear all conversations
TRUNCATE agent_conversations;

-- Or mark all as completed
UPDATE agent_conversations SET queue_status = 'completed', is_active = 0;
```

### Reset Specific User
```sql
UPDATE agent_conversations 
SET queue_status = 'cancelled', is_active = 0 
WHERE user_session = 'USER_SESSION_HERE';
```
